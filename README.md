# RobotCommander
Swing Based GUI that allows you to automate a list of commands and save that command list for later use.


How To Use:
1.) Create a new command and give it a name
2.) Open that command into the editor
3.) Start adding/deleting commands 
    -Summary of commands:
      Click - automates a single click wherever the mouse currently is
      DoubleClick - double click wherever mouse currently is
      Type - automates keyboard presses for whatever string you give it
      Wait - The robot will wait for a specific amount of time(allows things to load)
      MoveMouseTo - moves the mouse to a position (x,y) on screen
        - You can enable/disable the mouse tracker found in the file menu
      Quit - Stops the robot entirely
      If you don't quit - the robot goes on forever, until the program is shut down or
      you go into the menu and stop it. (BE CAREFUL)
4.) Start/Stop the Robot from the menu

Not really the best designed but is a pretty cool idea IMO
